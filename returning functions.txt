                            Returning Functions

1.  we create a outter function that takes in number as arg
    and return new function that takes number as arg aswell
    and from this function we can return operation that we want


const outterfn = (number) => (number2) => number * number2

is basicly:

function outterfn (number) {
    return function (number2){
        return number * number2
    }
}

2.  we store value of outterfn in new function:

const doublemynumbers = outterfn(2)

3.  we invoke new function double mynumbers with a number we want to double

const doublemynumbers(3) 

result : 6
