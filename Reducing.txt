                                Reduce

1.  Reducing array of data to a single value

    const nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    1.  0   =>  starting value
    2.  0+1 =>  add the first entry to starting value
    3.  1+2 =>  add the second entry to total
    4.  3+3 =>  add the third entry to total

    const nums = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100];
    const sum = nums.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current, 22);
    console.log(sum); //322

    array.reduce((acc,element)=> {
        ...
        return...
    },initialValue)

    1.  acc is the value we built up on top of initial value, so like current total
    2.  element is a single entry
    3.  we are telling reduce how to combine current value of acc with the 
        current element we have
    4.  initial value is a starting value    
    5.  acc is initialy equal to initialValue and then on second run is 
        equal to element
