                                    Mapping

1.  We call map on array and pass a function to the map that we want to 
    apply to each element in that array.
    Map then returns another array that contains the return values of the
    function for each element in our original array.

2.  It doesnt mutate original source, it returns a new copy.

3.  const arrray = [1,2,3]
    const doublevalues = array.map(number=>number *2)
