                                Recursion

1.  recursive function is a function that call itself inside its own body
    so we can achieve looping like effect without using looping

2. recursive function always needs a condition that tells function when to stop

const countdown = x => {
  if (x < 0) return;
  console.log(x);
  countdown(x - 1);
};

countdown(10);



const countup = (x, limit) => {
  if (x > limit) return;
  console.log(x);
  countup(x + 1, limit);
};

countup(1, 100);


1.  countup takes 2 args :number and upperlimit
2.  we set a condition, if x is larger than limit return(stop)
3.  countup invokes itself inside its own body
    and adds 1 for each iteration and sets limit to 100 in each iteration.
